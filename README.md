# Mono Application
This is a development repository. Contribution guide is really appreciated.

## Installation
Since this is a React Native application, you need to follow this [link](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started). Please select `React Native CLI`. After the React Native installation has been completed, you can

- Clone this repositories `git clone`
- Go to the cloned directory and run `npm install` to install any other depedencies.

## Contribution Guideline
Of course, you need to have a basic understanding of `GitHub`. I personally use `GitKraken` to perform the `commit` and `pull request`. 

### How to Submit a `pull request`
To submit a `pull request`, you need to create a new branch and create a `pull request` from that branch. For example, you want to merge `modify-readme` branch to `master`. You can create `pull request` from the `modify-readme` branch to `master`.

Please refer to `issue` if you want to make ` pull request`

## Issue Tracker
It is highly appreciated if you can start a new issue and assign the issue with correct label. For a question, you can use `question` label.
  
## Submitting Issue to Pull Request
To submit an `issue` to a `pull request` you need to set your comment description using the issue number. For example `pull request to fix issue #7`. In here, `#7` is the issue number.
